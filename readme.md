# Overview



This project was an exploration of what pandas, python, and altair can do. Using two datasets about Japan from the website kaggle, I imported, examined, reformatted, and played with the data.

# Data Analysis Results

I was able to use the datasets to gather Japan's total population, it's population by prefecture, and make a chart of Hokkaido's population increase/decline over time. 

The most challenging part of this assignment was by far importing over 40 csv files into a single dataframe. It took me hours of research and troubleshooting. And in the end, I didn't end up using that dataset because of time constraints. 

# Development Environment

I used Python, Pandas, and Altair


# Useful Websites


# Future Work

A lot more work could be done in analyzing the data and making charts of each. The most interesting part of the project would be analyzing data on both datasets, but the years are different for the datasets so I'm not sure how useful the data would be.
